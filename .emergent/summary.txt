The previous AI engineer successfully developed a complex football management simulation game from scratch. The development followed an iterative, test-driven approach, addressing user requests incrementally and fixing bugs promptly. Key challenges involved managing intricate game logic (player stats, match simulation, transfer market rules), ensuring robust frontend-backend integration, and handling persistent UI rendering issues due to environment constraints (ENOSPC errors, ESLint parsing errors). The AI demonstrated strong debugging skills, using  and  extensively to verify functionalities and identify issues. The focus was consistently on delivering core features and user experience, adhering to strict environment and UI/UX guidelines. The last interaction points to a bug in the match simulation related to player data access.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a football transfer and match simulation game with 8 teams. Each team is customizable (name, colors, budget €40M-€180M). There are 75 players (8 GKs, 33 DEF, 18 MIDs, 16 FWDs) with customizable stats (PASE, ÁREA, TIRO, REMATE, CÓRNER, PENALTI, REGATE, PARADA, DESPEJE, ROBO, BLOQUEO, ATAJADA) and resistance (4-14 matches). Players can be drafted (max 10 players, min 7 to start league, cyclic turn order, skip turn option). Teams can set clauses on players and buy from others (seller must retain 7 players). Players can be released for 90% of initial value. A free agent market opens at Jornada 7 and closes after Jornada 8. The league has 14 match days (all-vs-all, then repeated), with a pre-match phase for lineup selection (3 formations: 1GK,2DEF,3MID,1FWD; 1GK,3DEF,2MID,1FWD; 1GK,2DEF,2MID,2FWD). If a selected player is bought, the selling team gets an additional turn to replace them. Match simulation involves 9 turns per team, random actions (PASE 35%, REGATE 20%, TIRO 20%, CÓRNER 15%, ÁREA 10%), player selection by position probability, and defensive responses. After matches, local teams get €500k, plus €1M per point. Standings are based on points, goal difference, then goals scored.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack MVP**: React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database.
- **Data Persistence**: MongoDB with  and , UUIDs for player/team IDs.
- **Frontend Framework**: React with Tailwind CSS,  components.
- **API Communication**:  for frontend, FastAPI for backend with  prefix.
- **Game Logic**: Complex state management for turns, drafts, transfers, and match simulation.
- **Environment**: Kubernetes with Supervisor (not for modification).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:


- ****:
    - **Importance**: Main FastAPI application entry point. Contains all backend logic for game state, player/team management, draft, transfers, league, and match simulation. It defines all API endpoints and interacts with MongoDB.
    - **Changes Made**:
        - Initial implementation of player generation (75 players with 11 stats), team creation, draft logic, MongoDB integration.
        - Fix for  issues.
        - Addition of  player statistic and associated game logic for goalkeepers.
        - Correction for Not your turn error (expected POST body, refined turn logic,  model).
        - Implementation of skip turn in draft, 10-player team limit, clauses, and inter-team transfers.
        - Logic for league start with 7+ players.
        - Change from random to cyclic draft order.
        - Implementation of league calendar generation (14 jornadas), pre-match lineup selection and validation.
        - Endpoints for setting clauses, releasing players, and buying players from other teams.
        - Complex match simulation engine (9 turns, probabilities, chained actions, player selection, defensive logic, scoring, resistance, monetary rewards).
        - Logic for additional turn for teams whose lineup is disrupted by a player sale.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: Main React component. Handles all UI rendering, state management, and API calls to the backend. Manages different game phases (configuration, draft, league, pre-match, match viewer).
    - **Changes Made**:
        - Initial implementation of the game UI, including header, navigation, team creation form, player list, and player editing modal.
        - Logic to display 11 player statistics and later dynamically handle 12 (with ).
        - Fix for Reiniciar Juego button to reset teams but preserve player edits.
        - UI updates for  display and editing.
        - Correction for Not your turn error (sending POST body, correct  usage).
        - UI elements for skip turn, displaying 7-player minimum for league, clause/transfer buttons.
        - Display of league calendar, standings, formation selection interface.
        - Implementation of  component with tabs for Mi Equipo, Otros Equipos, Agentes Libres including buttons for setting clauses, releasing, and buying players.
        - Integration of match simulation UI, including  component and Jugar Siguiente Partido button.
        - UI to indicate Turno de Reemplazo and handle the additional turn logic when a player is bought from an active lineup.

- ** & **:
    - **Importance**: Configuration for environment variables.  for backend,  for frontend. Critical for service communication and database access.
    - **Changes Made**: No direct modifications were allowed or made to these files, adhering to the critical instruction.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: Directory for Shadcn UI components. Used for consistent and modern UI elements.
    - **Changes Made**: Components like , , , , ,  were used throughout the development as per the design guidelines. No direct modifications to these base components were mentioned, but  and related custom components were built using them.

<pending_tasks>
- Fix the bug where player data is being treated as an object instead of a dictionary, causing  error during match simulation.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate previous task was the full implementation and verification of the additional turn for lineup disruption feature, which successfully handled scenarios where a team loses a player from its active lineup due to a transfer and is granted a priority turn to select a replacement. The AI confirmed this functionality as 100% complete.

However, immediately after this confirmation, a new bug was reported by the user: . This error occurred during the match simulation phase, specifically when the system attempted to access player attributes (like 'regate') assuming the player data was an object, but it was being retrieved from MongoDB as a dictionary.

The AI's current work is to address this critical bug in the match simulation engine.
